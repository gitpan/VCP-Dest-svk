[Changes for 0.26 - 19 Sep, 2004]

* assign orig rev also when there's none.  This makes mirrors from cvs
  more relay-friendly.

[Changes for 0.25 - 4 Sep, 2004]

* Use a default pool in compare_base_rev.

* Use svk 0.20's commit --import instead of --import.

* Create our own changesets filter with the constrain on

  branched, next revsions on trunk and branch are idential changes. and this confuses
  the original grouping rules.

* Skip base check for placeholders.

  delete the others.
